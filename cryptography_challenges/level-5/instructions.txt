Your level 5 code is: C-af9d-2666-Z

Instructions for level 6:

Alice and Bob have encrypted the zip file for your next level.
Alice chose the encryption key K and Bob wanted to know what the 
key is. So Alice xored the key K with a random bit string R. 
Alice sent K xor R to Bob.  Bob didn't have R, so he created a new
random bit string S and sent K xor R xor S  back to Alice. 
Alice then removed her random bit string and sent the result, 
i.e., K xor S back to Bob. Now Bob could decrypt the key K by 
removing his own S. Alice and Bob know your key. Eve observed the
entire conversation and she says that the following are the three
messages exchanged between Alice and Bob. The messages' bitstrings
are shown encoded as hexadecimal values.

Alice to Bob: 9759c5b363745b15b6930ca65a508ded
Bob to Alice: b7be83d5415c703336b36d81fb803c7f
Alice to Bob: dc036d206d1421d727a53e802dcf986e

Find the key K and decrypt the zip file for your next level.
It was encrypted with RC4 using OpenSSL.
